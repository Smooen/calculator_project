This is going to be a functioning calculator, very cool.

To-do steps:

Implement Calculation after pressing equals button or second operator
Make it so adding the numbers will not concatenate them instead

Have it be impossible to input operant twice in a row



Flow of calc:

user inputs first number

user inputs one operant 

user inputs second number

if user inputs another op, calculate result
show result

...
user inputs another operant

user inputs another number
...

Press Equals to calculate result

Clear calulator -> reset all values and clear screen
